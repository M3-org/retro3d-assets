Thanks for downloading my free PSX Jewel Case asset~

The .obj models include a separated front, back, and disc model that you can apply the template art onto. Check the example art and file names for a guideline.

To add your own art:
- Drag any of the PNG templates into a photo-editing program and place your art behind it
- Add your own logos, text, screenshots, etc. on top of the images
- Try to keep similar naming conventions as the ones in the templates folder

To use the Unity package:
- Open a new or existing project in Unity
- Import as a custom package

If you use this to show off one of your game projects I'd love to see it! Feel free to tag me on Twitter @sodaraptor_dev.
